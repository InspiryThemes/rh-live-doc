Also, dynamic data is generated before few scripts based on various settings. So, Combining JavaScript files can create errors.\n\n\nReal Homes uses following cookies (if related settings are enabled).

An agent is a custom post type and any user with role equal or above author role can add those agents into database and later on assign properties to those agents.
